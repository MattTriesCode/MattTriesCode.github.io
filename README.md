# Portfolio Project

## Objective

Create an example portfolio website to practice some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as wireframing and planning for a project.  This portfolio site will contain several pages:

1. a home page
2. a projects page
3. a resume page
4. a contact page 

These will provide different areas for practicing the HTML structure and CSS styling of tables, forms, and images.  The project will also have a JavaScript file, a CSS file, and an images folder with a portfolio image, project screenshots, and social media link images.

## Portfolio Site Pages

### Home Page

The portfolio's home page, **index.html**, will introduce me and contain:

- A header with title and navigation links
- An introductory paragraph about myself
- A photo of myself
- A footer with social media links

### Projects

The projects page, **projects.html**, will be a grid or gallery of project blurbs, each of which will include:

- A screenshot of the project
- The project title
- A brief description of the project

These will be arranged using either CSS Grid or CSS Flexbox.

### Resume

The resume page, **resume.html**, will contain my fake resume, organized as an HTML table styled by CSS.  The resume will include:

- A name
- A fake address
- An objective
- Skills
- Past jobs

### Contact

The contact page, **contact.html**, will let visitors send me a message with an HTML form styled by CSS.  The form will contain the following fields:

- Their name
- Their email address
- Their message
- Yes/No radio buttons for a subscription
- A submit button
