Portfolio Project

In this project, I will create a portfolio template to practice some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as wireframing and planning for a project.  The portfolio will contain a main index page, a projects page, a resume page, and a contact page to provide different areas for practicing the HTML structure and CSS styling of tables, forms, and images.
